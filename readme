PS: Do not execute the sh's directly!!

To test:

make install		(installs AGL)

make test			(compiles the tester)
./test				(executes the tester)

The sh files make the assumption that the project folder is ~/aleva/agl/agl

Requirements:
- SDL development packages installed (base SDL, image, ttf, mixer)
- verify the commands in the ".sh" file and adapt to the machine in use (or 
just follow the instructions in the README.md)
